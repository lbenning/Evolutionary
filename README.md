Evolutionary
============

Evolutionary algorithms applied to various types of problems.

- Wargames - Contains wargame simulations - objective varies based on wargame. Genetic algorithm attempts to find optimal resource allocation.

- Prisoners - Contains simulations for Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, a well known game theory problem. Genetic algorithm attempts to evolve strategy, which over a long enough timeline is Tit-for-Tat.

- Traveling Salesman - Simulation to discover the shortest hamiltonian cycle on a set of 2d points. Runs 4 different genetic algorithms, a parametric optimizer that performs a stochastic hill climbing search, and a random search in an attempt to discover the optimal solution.
