# Evolutionary

Evolutionary algorithms applied to various types of problems.

1. Wargames - Contains a genetic algorithm to find the optimal allocation of resources in a simple wargame.

2. Prisoners - A simulation for Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, a well known game theory problem. Genetic algorithm attempts to evolve an optimal strategy, which over a long enough timeline is Tit-for-Tat.

3. Traveling Salesman - Simulation to discover the minimum cost Hamiltonian cycle on a set of 2d points. Runs 2 different genetic algorithms, a stochastic hill climbing search and a random search in an attempt to discover the optimal solution.

4. Symbolic Regression - Genetic program that evolves syntax trees representing mathematical formulas to fit a dataset of 2d points. Capable of learning functions involving binary operators (+,-,/,*) as well as unary operators (sin,cos,tan,sqrt).Runs a genetic program as well as a random search in an attempt to find the true function (if it exists, otherwise approximate).
