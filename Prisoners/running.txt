Running Details:

- Run javac Prisoners.java to produce the java class file by calling the Java compiler.
- Then to run the simulation, there are 2 options:

1. Run java Prisoners with the following 5 parameters:

  * Population Size - Must be an integer greater than 1. This is the number
  of individuals that will be in the population.

  * Mutation Rate - Must be a value between 0 and 1. This is the probability that
  an individual produced from crossover will be mutated.

  * Generations - Must be an integer greater than 0. This is the number of generations that the simulation will run for.

  * Recombination Rate - Must be a value between 0 and 1. This is the fraction
  of the population that will be selected for crossover.

  * Historical Length - This is the number of previous games an individual can
  consider when determining which move to make, i.e. Cooperate or Defect.

2. Run java Prisoners. This will run the simulation with the default parameters:
  * Population Size = 10, Mutation Rate = 0.005, Generations = 50000, 
  Recombination Rate = 0.8, Historical Length = 2.
